    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>My name is Kaitlyn Lippe. I was born and raised in Orange County, California. Through out childhood I spent time drawing, painting, and all around craft making. As an only child, having no other children in the house, I had to entertain myself, which led me to my creative hobbies. My background in painting and drawing has developed a in terest in design. Currently I am attending the University of San Francisco studying to become a graphic designer. Eventually I hope to work for a magazine as an art director.  </p>
