                    His family was not involved in the <span class="link">sciences</span>, except for a single distant relative working as a physicist. Alan's mother hoped he would study the classics, as a gentleman should do. Him and his brother found themselves in several <span class="link">foster homes</span> while their parents lived in India until 1926.

                On the morning of June 8, 1954 Turing's housecleaner found him dead.  He had committed suicide the day before through cyanide poisoning. The cleaner found him with a <span class="link">half eaten apple</span>, however no apple remains were found in his stomach in the autopsy. While his <span class="link"><a href="#wrapper-1">mother</a></span> argued this was merley an accident, the coroner's report ruled it as a suicide.

                    Growing up Turing faced the difficulties of fighting the demands of class. Surrounding him were discouragements of expression and discovery, which categorized his passion for science into an extra-curricular activity.

                    His incredible mind did him no use in school. He received mediocre or bad grades along with complaints from teachers. Despite some difficulties Turing did, however, find a friend in Christopher Morcom who developed an intellectual companionship with Turing. Morcom's sudden death in early 1930 inspired Turing to pursue the sciences further.
